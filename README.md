### Description:
This project is an implementation of the classic Tic-tac-toe game using React and Redux Toolkit.

### Features:
- The game screen is divided into two sides for "Player X" and "Player O".
- Updates to the game field are displayed simultaneously on both sides.
- When it's "Player X" turn, the field for "Player O" is disabled, and vice versa.
- When the game ends, the result is displayed on both sides for 5 seconds before the game restarts.
- Players can chat with each other at any time during the game.
- Any player can reset the game using the "Reset" button, which clears the field, score, and chat history.

### Usage:
- Open the game in your web browser.
- "Player X" starts the game by making a move.
- Players take turns making moves until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- Use the restart button to reset the game and start a new match.
